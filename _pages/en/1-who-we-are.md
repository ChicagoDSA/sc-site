# Who We Are

We are a multiracial coalition of alderpeople representing portions of 21 neighborhoods on the south, north, northwest, and lower west sides of Chicago. We are Black, white, Latinx, immigrants, descendents of immigrants, descendents of indigenous people, and descendents of slaves. We are the Democratic Socialist Caucus of the Chicago City Council.
