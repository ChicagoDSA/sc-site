We’re a diverse group of alderpeople representing 21 of Chicago’s 77 communities. We center working working class Chicagoans and movements for justice in our legislative work. We organize collectively - not act individually. We know that it is through bringing together working class communities from across Chicago that we can achieve the power needed to defeat rich and powerful special interests at City Hall. After all, bringing together working class Chicagoans to defeat special interests is how we all got elected. We are the Democratic Socialist Caucus of the Chicago City Council, and **we are fighting for a Chicago for all.**
