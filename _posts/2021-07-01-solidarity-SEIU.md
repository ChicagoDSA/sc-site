The following is a statement from the Democratic Socialist Caucus of the Chicago City Council:

> We stand in solidarity with striking SEIU Local 73 workers and call on Cook County and President Toni Preckwinkle to settle a fair contract with Local 73 today. SEIU 73 workers have kept Cook County functioning and kept patients safe throughout the pandemic. Now, those workers are on strike for a fair contract. Local 73â€™s contract proposals have been reasonable and clear: fair raises, equal pay for equal work, affordable healthcare. President Preckwinkle and Cook County have the power to do the right thing and do right by Local 73 essential workers.
