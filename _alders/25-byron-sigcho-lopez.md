Byron Sigcho Lopez was elected Alderman of Chicagoâ€™s 25th Ward to reform city government and to push back against austerity measures that disproportionately burden working class communities. Byron came to the United States alone as a teenager. Byron has worked as an adult education teacher for the last 10 years, founding the bilingual adult education program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He became politically active after former-Mayor Rahm Emanuel listed a neighborhood public school for closure where Byron volunteered as a soccer coach. Byron led a successful community effort to keep that school open. Later, Byron became Director of the Pilsen Alliance where he was a leader in the struggle against gentrification and displacement, co-founding the campaign to lift the ban on rent control in Illinois. He holds a bachelors in Mathematics and Business Administration from Cumberland University, and a Masters in Economics from the University of Illinois at Chicago. He is currently a PhD candidate in the field of Urban Education Policy.
