Rossana Rodriguez Sánchez is a Boricua mother, educator, theatre artist, organizer and the Alderwoman of Chicago’s 33rd Ward. She spent the last decade working with youth and families in Albany Park. Originally from Puerto Rico, Rossana attended her first demonstration at the age of six, when her neighborhood of Mariana waged a successful battle for public access to drinking water. Since then she has become a fierce advocate for public education, fighting against privatization and school closings in Puerto Rico and in Chicago. As a resident of Albany Park and founding member of 33rd Ward Working Families, Rossana has also been a leader in the fights for rent control and immigrant rights in her ward. Rossana holds a BA in Theater Education and an MA in Applied Theater and is currently pursuing an MSW. Her main focus of work is mental health and the creation of systems of care to replace the racist systems of punishment we now understand as “public safety.”
