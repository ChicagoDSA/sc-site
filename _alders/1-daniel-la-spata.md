Daniel La Spata serves as the Alderman of Chicago's 1st Ward. He was inspired to run after witnessing anti-democratic and inequitable development processes, which left too many out of the prosperity of the city's booming economy and housing market. He has spent the last twenty years in Chicago and the last thirteen as a leader on housing and community development campaigns in the greater Logan Square area. Currently a Masters' Candidate in Urban Planning and Public Policy at UIC, Daniel also took on fruitful professional experiences with the Chicago Rehab Network, Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, and Friends of the Parks. As Alderman, Daniel is working toward a more equitable and sustainable Chicago. A Chicago committed to breaking down it's segregated past (and present) and weathering the storms of climate change will take a multitude of stakeholders and sometimes unlikely partnerships. He balances this exhausting but fulfilling work by running, baking, making excellent music, and sharing life and travel with his wonderful wife Alicia.
