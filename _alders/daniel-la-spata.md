Alderman Daniel LaSpata was elected to 1st Ward Alderman on February 26th, 2019. He has spent the last twenty years in Chicago and the last thirteen as a leader on housing and community development campaigns in the greater Logan Square area. Currently a Masters’ Candidate in Urban Planning and Public Policy at UIC, Daniel also took on fruitful professional experiences with the Chicago Rehab Network, Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, and Friends of the Parks.

He was inspired to run for office after witnessing anti-democratic and inequitable development processes, which left too many out of the prosperity of the city’s booming economy and housing market. As Alderman, Daniel hopes to lend his political leadership and organizing experience to the development of a more equitable and sustainable Chicago. A Chicago committed to breaking down its segregated past (and present) and weathering the storms of climate change will take a multitude of stakeholders and sometimes unlikely partnerships.
